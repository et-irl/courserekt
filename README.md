## Purpose

It is rather unfortunate that NUS does not keep a record of the Demand Allocation Reports. Furthermore, the data is presented in such a verbose and hard-to-visualise way. This app aims to streamline this process, making analysis of a course's past popularity more accessible and straightforward.

The site harmonises the data from Vacancy Reports as well as Demand Allocation Reports to provide the best-known information about a course at any time. Demand Allocation Reports, while they represent a lot of information, is not the full picture. Some courses are omitted from the demand allocation reports if there are no available seats, or if nobody registered for them, or are just deemed unimportant. This is where we use the Vacancy Reports to back our information up.

## For Users:

### Search Bar

You can delimit your search with spaces. For example, "AC5001 CS2" will show all course codes that have "AC5001" or "CS2" in its name.

### Accessing the PDF data

You can click the column headers to access the raw PDF data used to generate the table for the respective year, semester, and undergraduate/graduate type.

### Interpreting table cells

Each cell corresponds to the data in the PDF for the course's class and round number, in the format `x / y (z)`.

`x` is the `Demand` and `y` is the `Vacancy` as per the CourseReg PDF, i.e., `x` people are vying for `y` slots.

`z` is the `Vacancy` as per the Vacancy PDF, corresponding to the student type of `UG` or `GD` depending on which tab you are viewing.

`y` should usually be around `z`, as `z` is the University's way of predicting the number of `y` before intervention.

- If `0 / z (z)` is displayed, no data found in the CourseReg PDF. This could be because:
    - Nobody selected this course, despite having vacancies.
    - Nobody selected this course, but only because it was not selectable. (For example, GEN courses in Round 0.)
    - (Unlikely) The admin changed the number of vacancies retroactively to `0`, so nobody can get in regardless.
- If `y` is displayed as `âˆž`, the `Vacancy` in the respective PDF is `-`.
- If `N/A` is displayed, the class data was neither found in the Vacancy PDF nor the CourseReg PDF.
